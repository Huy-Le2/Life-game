Cave entrance
You walk down the narrow corridor and enter a large cavern. The walls are covered with various animal skeletons; your guess is that there were once many animals here but now they have all died.

Cave loop N
Curious even more, you fully commit yourself to this expedition. Leaving your car behind, you venture deeper into the cave, traveling further and further down the suffocating squeeze of the cave's corridor. You end up in what seems to be the hollowed-out innards of the cave. Its interior has been flooded with water (how?) and it is surprisingly spacious despite being underground. It must have been an enormous natural sinkhole at one time -- perhaps when the whole mountain collapsed? The cave is lit by some kind of glowy fungus growing on the ceiling.You notice that it only goes forward in one direction.
