# Life-game

## A simple text-based adventure game in C++

The game will basically simulate an average month of someone who is in college or is about to graduate from one. The game is sort of created to see how one person would act if gieven the opportunity to spend without consequences. This would prove to be a good source of consideration for those who want to experiement with people's psychology on money and the aspect of spending it. Although the project is currently incomplete as there are still a lot of mechanics and variables which aren't fully understood, like tracking personal money spending or tracking history of travel, I think that this serves as a good base line to determine the overall mentality of people with spending money.
The entire prorgam is completely written in  ```C++``` as it was the best language to use for designating class and certain variable function.

Overall I think that the project and I have a lot of room for growth in the future.
